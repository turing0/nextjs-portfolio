The activitypubproject allows users to publish updates, photos, videos and other content from different ActivityPub clients with just one login. Users can connect accounts from diverse ActivityPub platforms like Mastodon, Pixelfed, Plurk, Idhyad, and many others under one identity.

Switching between clients is seamless. Whatever updates, likes or follows you do on one platform will automatically appear on your other connected accounts. Your content, followers and profile info is synced real-time across all your accounts.

With the activitypubproject, you have the flexibility to engage with different communities on different platforms but still maintain one comprehensive profile and timeline. You can customize which platforms you use for publishing or consuming different types of content. The possibilities are endless!
